This is a project focused on creating simple animations using the HTML Canvas and Vanilla Javascript. 
My primary reference for this project is the tutorial by the Youtube channel Franks laboratory titled "JavaScript Side Scroller Game Tutorial"

The project has two parts: A parallax animation reminiscent of sidescroller games and a sprite animation with various options.
